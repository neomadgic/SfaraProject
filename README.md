# SfaraProject

SfaraProject is an app that uses the user's current location to display the current weather. It will also logs the last 5 observation and displays.

NOTE: SfaraProject uses UserDefaults to store a few variable. When testing the app on Xcode, do not press the stop button, because it may not save correctly. Besides that, it is a fully functional app and can be used on phones. Real devices won't have the issue because there are no stop button on phones.
